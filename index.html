            <h2>Charles Rivett-Carnac (sailor)</h2>
            <p>
                Charles James Rivett-Carnac (18 February 1853 in Brahmapur, Orissa, British India â€“ 9 September 1935 in Jersey, Channel Islands) was a British sailor who competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was the owner of the British boat Heroine III, which won the gold medal in the 7 metre class. However, since it was the only entry in this class, this feat is somewhat less impressive. More importantly, his second wife Frances Rivett-Carnac was one of the four-member crew and won Olympic gold with him. The Rivett-Carnacs thus became the first husband-and-wife team to share Olympic gold. Their granddaughter Cleone Rivett-Carnac was an athlete in New Zealand. Rivett-Carnac remains the oldest Briton, at 55, to have won an Olympic gold medal for yachting.
